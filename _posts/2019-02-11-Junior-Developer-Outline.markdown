We had a junior developer join our team who had virtually no prior development experience.  Not to go into too many details of how we ended up hiring her, but she showed a real knack for understanding development concepts so we decided to give her a shot. To begin from square one, I created a comprehensive outline on the tools she would need to learn and any skills needed including domain knowledge about our product.  I segmented the outline into a rough timeline.  There was virtually no way to predict how quickly she would be able to pick all this information up, but the timeline estimated turned out to be pretty accurate.  Here is the outline:

Task Outline
------------
Week 1
- get accounts setup
    - gmail
    - zoom
    - slack
    - github access
- meet team (again)
- expectations of a dev
    - what makes a good dev
        - Go Slow!
    - be able to explain what you did
    - comment the code - When commenting code explaining why you did something is more important than explaining what the code does.  It's easy to read the code and figure out what it does, but developers generally don't have an idea of why a certain piece of the code was written.
    - don’t guess, research what you don’t know
    - Take your time!
- Product overview
    - Product area 1
    - Product area 2
    - Product area 3
    - Go over basic use case from creation to completion
- Use the Product
    - basic use case from start to finish
- Friday Items
    - Use the app as a user on her own
        - basic use case from start to finish
